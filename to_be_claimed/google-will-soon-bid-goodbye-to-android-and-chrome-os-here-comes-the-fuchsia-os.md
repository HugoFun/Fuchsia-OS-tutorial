For the billions of Android users who are so comfortable using Android OS and phones running on the platform for years now, it might be a big surprise. If you are a technology nerd, you might have probably come across this already. Google is going to introduce Fuchsia OS, the one platform to rule them all to replace both Android and Chrome OS in the next one or two years.

The rollout will be handled in the most seamless manner so that smartphone users and developers don’t bear the brunt. After all, thousands of Android apps are already running successfully on so many phones across the globe and trying to port them all to a brand new operating system is no easy task. Google has already been helping developers make the transition as seamless as possible.

The Fuchsia OS is in development since 2016 and the transition is about to take place in the near future. After the Google I/O main event took place, the team took their time to discuss the possibilities and also revealed a lot of new information with regards to this platform. On the contrary to what a lot of people believed, the OS is not going to try to directly replace Android or Chrome operating systems but rather will be used in futuristic devices.

In other words, it’s core focus will be on Google Assistant AI and other future technologies as well as gadgets. Newer items like AR and VR headsets, smart watches and smart home devices will be powered by this new technology. If we try to understand what they mean, it probably means it will be integrated into Android slowly and will not be done explicitly so as to not confuse the current users. Besides, convincing thousands of developers and brands to rework on their existing apps will not be a great idea either, as things have been going good for Android for many years now.

Similar to Android, Fuchsia OS will be an open source project which will accept contributions from everyone and anyone outside the Google circle. It will enable the platform to get developed at a rapid rate and also get rid of bugs among other issues faster. Apple iOS took a long time to implement features that were found on Android OS three years ago because of its open source concept and a similar approach might help Fuchsia become the norm on a wide range of devices unifying them all.
